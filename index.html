		<h1>Konoba - On our knees</h1>
		<p>For our only hope is falling in love<br>
with who we are and what we wanna do.<br>
Is it gonna be you, is it gonna be me?<br>

Well something's gotta happen<br>
or we'll be on our knees.<br>
On our knees..<br>

For our only hope is falling in love<br>
with who we are and what we wanna do.<br>
Is it gonna be you, is it gonna be me?<br></p>
	     <p>Well something's gotta happen
or we'll be on our knees.
On our knees..

Feel it in your bones -
the need for something more.
The more and more you wait
		     it's burning you.</p>
		<p> Feel it in your bones -
the need for something more.
The more and more you wait
it's burning you

Burning you
Burning you
Burning you
you

Feel it in your bones -
the need for something more.
The more and more you wait
it's burning you</p>
		<p>Feel it in your bones -
the need for something more.
The more and more you wait
it's burning you

If only you could see
the pain you're causing me -
I feel it in my blood,
it's burning me.

Burning you
Burning you
Burning you
you</p>
